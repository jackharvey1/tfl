# PROBLEMS
Why does the amount of entries shown in robomongo not match the saved + already saved output?
Is having to have the db running for tests to pass bad? If so, how do I mock it out? Fails on `mongoose.connect`.
Stations are being saved twice as multiple lines have one station
`module.exports`, e.g. `module.exports.makeRequest` is needed for tests. Is there a way to not do this?
